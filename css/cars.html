            <h2>Porsche 911</h2>
            <p>The Porsche 911 (pronounced Nine Eleven or in German: Neunelfer) is a two-door 2+2 high performance rear-engined sports car introduced in September 1964 by Porsche AG of Stuttgart, Germany. It has a rear-mounted flat-six engine and originally a torsion bar suspension. The car has been continuously enhanced through the years but the basic concept has remained unchanged.</p>

            <h2>VW Beetle</h2>
            <p>The Beetle was commissioned in the 1930s by Adolf Hitler as the "people's car" (or volks wagen in German). Designed by Ferdinand Porsche, the curvy car was affordable, practical and reliable. Three decades later, the "Bug" (as it was affectionately known) became a symbol of the 1960s and the "small is beautiful" ethos.</p>

            <h2>Nissan Skyline GT-R R32</h2>
            <p>At the car’s heart was the legendary RB26DETT 2.6-litre in-line six DOHC twin-turbo engine. Rated at 276bhp and 260lb ft of torque, it was under-stressed and ripe for tuning – 1,000bhp was attainable. Moreover, it boasted a heady red line – a rarity for turbo motors, placed at 8,000rpm.
